Gravity: Friend or Foe?
=======================

**Gravity: Friend or Foe?** is a game in which you use gravity to move
objects and score.

In order to build _Gravity_ you need the following libraries:

 - SDL2
 - SDL2_ttf
 - SDL2_mixer
 - OpenGL
 - GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)
 - Box2D

In order to build run `./waf configure` and then `./waf build`. A
C++11 compliant compiler is needed.

Only tested on Linux so far, but building on other systems should be
possible.
